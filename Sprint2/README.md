In our mob programming session on 7/12/22, we:
- reviewed our first batch of major styling improvements to the authentication screen.
- reviewed how to best structure our git workflow for collaborative development
- we also resolved issues getting the app working on various team members' machines due to environment differences in the operating system.

## Test Suite

// TODO

## CI System

The CI System we chose to use was [Codemage](https://codemagic.io/start/). The reason we chose this is because the core stack of our application is React Native to support Android/iOS/web in as reusable way as possible. Because of that we needed a CI tool that supported this in a first-class manner, which Codemagic supported out of the box. We also went with a managed solution because the effort in putting together an in-house CI system like with Jenkins would be better spent in getting the application ready for customer review.

 Your rationale for the CI tool used (i.e., why did you use this CI tool?) is clearly documented in your git repo, plus the evidence/link is included in your gitâ€™s repo.
