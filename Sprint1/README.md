## Mob Programming Session

In our mob programming session on 6/26/22, we:
- Found two bugs with login.
    - the login password text field should have secure text enabled which was done during the call.
    - the login network request wasn't using the text input values and always failing.
- This led to us realizing that there were some areas to improve related to clearer error states for the user.
- Implemented signing out of an account together.

## Test Suite

As of 8/5/2022, our test coverage comprised of 10 tests across 3 test suites:

## Daily Scrum (From July 1, 2022)
Alvin:
- I added some dependencies needed for our test suite to work with our stack and started adding coverage to the authentication flows.
- I will then add more test coverage around the sign up and sign out flows.
- Not really a blocker, but work was busy this week so I didn't have the bandwidth I initially expected to have for this sprint.

Aparna:
- Broke down outstanding product backlog items into tasks that can be pulled into sprints
- Continue refining backlog items and task breakdown
- Only blocker is not feeling well so limited bandwidth

Ploynapas:
- I forecasted user stories for Sprint 1. 
- Conducted sprint review, and continuing to monitor forecast to improve for next Sprint.
- No blockers

Mohan:
- Yesterday, I worked on reviewing the code
- Reviewing code and kanban board items as it relates to the product development
- I dont have any blockers

## Sprint Review (July 3, 2022)

- We also made some progress in the app development by mob programming (See the "Mob Programming Session" section above)!

- We also took our product backlog items and started turning them into tasks that can be pulled into sprints:

- We also started scaffolding out the program itself with fully functional signup/login/signout authentication:
